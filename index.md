I am an Assistant Instructional Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. I graduated with a PhD in statistics from UChicago in August 2023, jointly advised by Peter McCullagh and Chao Gao. In 2017, I received an ScB. in Applied Mathematics from Brown University. My current research interests are in large scale hypothesis testing and selective inference.
